# NL_to_FOL_T5FineTuning
This code is developed for training and evaluating a model that translates natural language (NL) sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions using a T5-based model.

For the equivalence metric to work, Prover9 must be downloaded from the following website: https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/

This code is a slightly modified version of the one used in the master's thesis titled "Transformer Models for Translating Natural Language Sentences into Formal Logical Expressions," authored by Ä°brahim Ethem Deveci. The full thesis can be accessed at the following link: https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/109445.
