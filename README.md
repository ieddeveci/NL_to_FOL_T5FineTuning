# NL_to_FOL_T5FineTuning

This code is a slightly modified version of the one used for training and evaluating a T5 language model that translates natural language (NL) sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions in my master's thesis titled "Transformer Models for Translating Natural Language Sentences into Formal Logical Expressions. A more detailed explanation of the code, the task, and the evaluation metrics can also be found in the full [thesis](https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/109445).

For the equivalence metric to function properly, Prover9 must be downloaded from the following website: [Prover9](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/).

The dataset used for this thesis will be released following the publication of a paper derived from the thesis.
