# NL_to_FOL_T5FineTuning
This code is developed for training and evaluating a model that translates natural language (NL) sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions using a T5-based model.

This code is part of the master's thesis titled "Transformer models for translating natural language sentences into formal logical expressions," authored by Ä°brahim Ethem Deveci. The full thesis can be accessed at the following link: https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/109445.
